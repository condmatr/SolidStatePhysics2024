# Solid State Physics 2024
Teaching material for the ["Solid State Physics course at Aalto University 2024"](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=38577#section-0)

## Interactive exercise sessions
The folder sessions contains the Jupyter notebooks for the different sessions of the course
- [Session 3: Electronic structure theory](https://github.com/joselado/SolidStatePhysics2024/blob/main/notebooks/session3.ipynb)
- [Session 4: Topological band structure theory](https://github.com/joselado/SolidStatePhysics2024/blob/main/notebooks/session4.ipynb)
- [Session 5: The Quantum Hall state](https://github.com/joselado/SolidStatePhysics2024/blob/main/notebooks/session5.ipynb)
- Session 6: Superconductivity, Nambu representation and Majorana physics (soon)
- Session 7: Magnetism, magnons, quantum magnetism and spinons (soon)
- Session 8: Excitations and defects in quantum materials (soon)

## Install
The Jupyter notebooks use [pyqula](https://github.com/joselado/pyqula), and can be installed from a terminal with pip as

```bash
pip install --upgrade pyqula
```

## Recordings of the lecture sessions
Each exercise session has an associated lecture session with the theory background. The recordings of the associated theory sessions can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFe4plnPHPtFUzzSO0DkLyh41DjiwdYAa).
